Your device is unable to obtain a valid IP address. This is most likely because your Wi-Fi or LAN connection is disconnected.

### Solution

1. Launch the network settings panel on your device.
2. Ensure that you are connected to a valid network.
3. Check that your device is retrieving a valid IP address.
4. If this does not resolve the error, try rebooting your device or running your system's network diagnostics tool.
