# Cloudflare Durable Objects

{{<description>}}

A globally distributed coordination API with strongly consistent storage.

{{</description>}}

{{<plan type="paid">}}

Durable Objects provide a powerful API for coordinating the actions of multiple clients or users, each with private, transactional and strongly consistent storage attached.

Developers use Durable Objects to to build collaborative editing, interactive chat, multiplayer games and other applications that have a strong need to coordinate the actions of multiple clients, without requring you to build serialization and coordination primitives on your own. 

You can create millions of (or more) Durable Objects, representing a document, chat session, multiplayer game or other aspect of your system where events need to be coordinated or serialized. Each Durable Object is automatically located as close to the client or user as possible, minimizing latency between the client and Durable Objects.
